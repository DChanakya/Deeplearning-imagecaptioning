# Deeplearning-imagecaptioning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an image captioning model that generates meaningful descriptions for images in the Flickr8k dataset. Using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention mechanisms, we aim to bridge computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) to improve machine understanding of visual information. Potential applications include assistive technologies for visually impaired individuals, automatic photo tagging, and image search engines.

## Dataset
- **Dataset:** [[Flickr8k on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k)]
- **Description:** Contains 8,000 images, each paired with five captions describing the imageâ€™s scene or objects. The dataset is diverse and manageable in size for training an image captioning model.

## Approach

### Model Architecture
1. **Image Feature Extraction (CNN):** We will use a pretrained CNN, such as VGG16 or ResNet, for image feature extraction. This will allow the model to learn visual features efficiently by leveraging transfer learning.
2. **Caption Generation (RNN with LSTM):** A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based RNN will process the extracted image features and generate captions word-by-word.
3. **Attention Mechanism:** To improve caption relevance and alignment with image content, we will integrate an attention mechanism that helps the model focus on specific image regions during the caption generation process.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **BLEU Score:** We will use the BLEU score, a standard metric for evaluating generated text by comparing it to reference captions.
- **Qualitative Evaluation:** Manually reviewing generated captions to assess fluency and relevance.
